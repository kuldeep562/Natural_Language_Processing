# NLP Practical Assignments – 2024

This repository contains the implementation of 10 practical tasks assigned as part of the Natural Language Processing coursework under the Department of Computer Science, Gujarat University.

## 📋 Tasks Overview

1. **Text Preprocessing**  
   Tokenization, stopword removal, stemming, and lemmatization using NLTK on a subset of the movie reviews dataset.

2. **Part-of-Speech Tagging**  
   POS tagger using NLTK evaluated with the Penn Treebank dataset.

3. **Named Entity Recognition**  
   NER model built using spaCy and evaluated with the CoNLL-2003 dataset.

4. **Ambiguity Analysis**  
   Analysis of lexical, syntactic, and semantic ambiguities using the Brown Corpus.

5. **Sentiment Analysis**  
   Machine learning-based sentiment analysis model trained on the IMDB movie reviews dataset.

6. **Text Classification**  
   News article classification using the 20 Newsgroups dataset.

7. **Language Modeling**  
   N-gram based language model evaluated using WikiText-2.

8. **Machine Translation**  
   Sequence-to-sequence model for English-French translation using the WMT14 dataset.

9. **Text Generation**  
   RNN-based text generator trained on literary works from Project Gutenberg.
